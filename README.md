Beneath A Code Sky
==================

Beneath A Code Sky is a project borned at **Academia de Código**'s _Bootcamp #2_ **24 Hour Hackathon Competition**.
The game is a 2D interactive educational programming game where the player learns programming basics while playing. The original idea for this project is based on a 90's game called Beneath A Still Sky. This is still a work in progress and our main goal is to have a game where the player can learn basic programming and stimulates creativity as each level can be solved in multiple ways. 

It is the Hackathon Competition winning project.

Gameplay
--------

User controls a character with Keyboard:
  * Right Arrow - move right;
  * Left Arrow - move left;
  * ENTER - use terminal;
  * ESC - exit terminal;
  * _more keys will be added (see "Most Notable TODO's)_
 
The player moves like most 2D platform games. The character can move right, left, jump and crouch as well and interacts with objects both physically and technologically.

The character has a mobile device with a terminal console that interacts and manipulates objects to complete the necessary tasks for each level. To do so, the user must submit pseudo-code based in simple languages like Ruby _(i.e. to push a box, the user must call the object "box", and the action "push" which is an existing method that pushes the box - "box.push")_.

Level difficulty increases with more complex enigmas to solve each new level, taking into consideration a pedagogic approach over programming learning process.


Most Notable TODO's
-------------------

  * Finalize game storyline and pedagogic structure and enigmas;
  * Add new levels;
  * Add window/button with objects and actions available;
  * Improve Level Completed validation.
