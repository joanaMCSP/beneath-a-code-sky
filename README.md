Beneath A Code Sky
==================

Beneath A Code Sky is a project borned at **Academia de Código**'s _Bootcamp #2_ **24 Hour Hackathon Competition**.
The game is a 2D interactive educational programming game in which the player learns programming basics while playing. The original idea for this project is based on a 90's game called Beneath A Still Sky. This is still a work in progress and our main goal is to have a game in which the player can learn basic programming and creative thinking as each level can be solved in multiple ways. 

It is the Hackathon Competition winning project.

Gameplay
--------

User controls a character with Keyboard:
  * Right Arrow - move right;
  * Left Arrow - move left;
  * ENTER - show terminal;
  * ESC - hide terminal;
  * _more keys will be added (see "Most Notable TODO's)_
 
The player moves like most 2D platform games. The character can move right, left, jump and crouch as well and interact with objects both physically and through basic syntax commands.

The character has a mobile device with a terminal console that interacts and manipulates objects to complete the necessary tasks for each level. To do so, the user must submit pseudo-code based in simple languages like Ruby _(i.e. to push a box, the user must call the object "box", and the action "push" which is a declared method that pushes the box - "box.push")_.

Level difficulty increases with more complex enigmas to solve , taking into consideration a pedagogic approach over the  programming learning process.


Most Notable TODO's
-------------------

  * Finalize game storyline and pedagogic structure and enigmas;
  * Add new levels;
  * Add window/button with objects and actions available;
  * Improve Level Completed validation.
